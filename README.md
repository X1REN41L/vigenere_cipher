# Vigenère Cipher Encoder & Decoder

## Description
This is a simple GUI-based Vigenère Cipher encoder and decoder built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to encode or decode text using a password. The cipher only supports alphabetic characters and does not process numbers. If numbers are used, an error message will be displayed.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Logging system to track processes.
